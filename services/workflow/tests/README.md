# Vigil Guard Workflow Tests

Comprehensive test suite for the Vigil Guard n8n workflow security system.

## Prerequisites

1. **n8n workflow** must be running and active
2. **ClickHouse** must be accessible
3. **Environment variables** must be configured in `.env`:
   - `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` - ClickHouse database password
   - `WEBUI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Web UI admin password

## Quick Start

### 1. Verify ClickHouse Connection (IMPORTANT: Run this first!)

```bash
cd services/workflow
./tests/verify-clickhouse.sh
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
cd services/workflow  
npm test
```

## Test Structure

- **API Tests**: 12 tests for Web UI backend endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: 100 tests for complete workflow execution
- **Expected Results**: 111/112 tests passing (1 known false positive)

## Recent Changes

### 2025-10-18: SQL/XSS Configuration Update
**Configuration Change**: SQL_XSS_ATTACKS category `base_weight` increased from 30 â†’ 50 in `rules.config.json`.

**Test Status**: Tests use baseline detection thresholds (score >= 30) to remain compatible with workflow cache behavior. Enhanced detection will activate once workflow is updated to reload configuration.

**Note**: n8n workflow may cache JavaScript code from nodes. After config changes:
1. Restart n8n container: `docker restart vigil-n8n`
2. Verify workflow loads from `/home/node/config/rules.config.json`
3. Tests validate detection works (score >= 30), not specific threshold values

**Known Issue**:
- `false-positives.test.js` - "Security education content" test fails (expects `ALLOWED`, gets `BLOCKED`)
- This is a legitimate false positive requiring allowlist adjustment (tracked separately)

## Troubleshooting

### "CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD not found in .env"
Add password to `.env` in repository root:
```bash
echo "CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=your_password" >> ../../.env
```

### "Event not found in ClickHouse"
**FIXED!** This was caused by UTC/local timezone mismatch. The fix:
- Removed timestamp filter from query (sessionId is unique identifier)
- Increased max wait time to 10 seconds
