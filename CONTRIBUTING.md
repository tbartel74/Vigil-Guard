## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ‚â• 18.0.0
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Familiarity with TypeScript, React, and Express.js

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vigil-guard.git
   cd vigil-guard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Web UI Frontend
   cd services/web-ui/frontend
   npm install

   # Web UI Backend
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development services**
   ```bash
   # Create Docker network
   docker network create vigil-network

   # Start all services using main docker-compose
   docker-compose up -d

   # Or start individual services
   cd services/monitoring
   docker-compose up -d

   cd ../workflow
   docker-compose up -d

   # Start Web UI in development mode
   cd ../web-ui/frontend
   npm run dev

   # In another terminal
   cd ../web-ui/backend
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode, avoid `any` types
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Formatting**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - PascalCase for components and types
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### Git Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Keep commits atomic and focused
   - Follow conventional commits format

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run TypeScript compiler
   cd services/web-ui/frontend
   npx tsc --noEmit

   cd ../backend
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

4. **Commit with descriptive messages**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new detection pattern for XYZ"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(web-ui): add dark mode toggle to settings page
fix(backend): resolve ETag validation issue on concurrent updates
docs(readme): update installation instructions for Windows
feat(workflow): add new detection pattern for polyglot attacks
fix(monitoring): correct ClickHouse query performance issue
```

## üîí Critical Files - Modify with Care

‚ö†Ô∏è **The following directories contain critical detection patterns and security rules:**

### Configuration Files (`services/workflow/config/`)
- `unified_config.json` - Main security policies
- `thresholds.config.json` - Decision thresholds (0-100 scale)
- `rules.config.json` - Detection patterns
- `allowlist.schema.json` - Allowlist validation schema
- `normalize.conf` - Normalization mappings
- `pii.conf` - PII redaction patterns

**Important:**
- Always use the Web UI for configuration changes when possible
- Changes to these files directly affect security posture
- Test configuration changes thoroughly before deploying
- Document the rationale for threshold adjustments
- Maintain backup copies before modifying

### Security-Critical Code
- `services/web-ui/backend/src/auth.ts` - Authentication logic
- `services/web-ui/backend/src/fileOps.ts` - File operations (path traversal protection)
- `services/web-ui/backend/src/database.ts` - User database operations

Changes to these files require security review. See [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for security considerations.
