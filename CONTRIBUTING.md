   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode, avoid `any` types
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Formatting**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - PascalCase for components and types
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### Git Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Keep commits atomic and focused
   - Follow conventional commits format

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run TypeScript compiler
   cd GUI/frontend
   npx tsc --noEmit

   cd ../backend
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

4. **Commit with descriptive messages**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new detection pattern for XYZ"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(gui): add dark mode toggle to settings page
fix(backend): resolve ETag validation issue on concurrent updates
docs(readme): update installation instructions for Windows
```

## üîí Critical Files - DO NOT MODIFY

‚ö†Ô∏è **The following directory contains critical detection patterns and security rules:**

- `n8n/config_sanitizer/` - **DO NOT** modify:
  - Directory name
  - File names
  - File contents

These files contain carefully tuned detection patterns. Use the GUI for configuration changes instead.
